    desc: Virtual address of PC when program COF happens due to non-deterministic cases
desc: |-
  Shall precede the very first instruction encoding record, and be emitted for
  any program change of flow (COF) due to non-deterministic cases.
  
  Every tool that creates/modifies stf file shall append a ForcePCRecord to
  indicate the starting PC address.
  
  This record indicates virtual address of PC when program change of flow (COF)
  happens due to non-deterministic cases
  
  The next STF_INST_16 / STF_INST_32 record's virtual address will match this
  record's virtual address
  
  Trace tools shall output the architectural PC (even if the low/high bits are
  non-zero - e.g. ARM). Some architectures may add behaviours based on the
  low/high bits.
  
  Note this record is always 64 bit, even when running in 32bit IEM.
  
  stf_dump shows this record as a standalone line item prefix "FORCE_PC"
