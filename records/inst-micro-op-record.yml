  Used by trace morphing tools to inject new instruction encoding records, a technique used to run micro-architecture "what-if" studies when original instruction is replaced by more than one instruction
  
  Use-cases:
  
  . Instruction replacement 1:1 in which case trace's replaced instruction would be indicated by STF_INST_32 record. In this case there is no microop record emitted in the trace
  
  . Instruction replacement 1:n where n = (#of microops emitted + 1).
  
  In both cases following hold true:

  * The original Instruction record STF_INST_MICROOP replacement and/or microop related changes to memory accesses, operand reg records etc. are emitted(or removed) in the trace before the original STF_INST_32/16 record that defines instruction boundary for all artifacts related to the instruction(IRG)
