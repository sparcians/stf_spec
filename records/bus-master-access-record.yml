  Shall be used to capture memory accesses by masters other than the primary core being traced.
  
  Memory access initiator index distinguishes between multiple instances of one type of master (another core, second accelerator port, etc.)
  
  Use Cases:

  * Another coreâ€™s snoop
  * I/O device read/write
