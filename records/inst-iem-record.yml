  Every tool that creates/modifies stf file shall append/update the InstIEMRecord.
  
  Shall precede the very first instruction encoding record and every instruction
  encoding change (STF_INST_16 or STF_INST_32) Note: other instruction encoding
  lengths (e.g. 48-bit are not supported at this time)
  
  Instruction encoding mode interpretation will depend on the ISA being traced, as
  captured in the ISARecord.
