:record-name: VLenConfigRecord
:record-enum: STF_VLEN_CONFIG (10)
:record-mandatory: If a trace includes vector instructions
include::../../include/stf-record.adoc[tag=record-fields]
* b[31:0] VLEN of the vector instructions present in the trace
include::../../include/stf-record.adoc[tag=record-desc]
Shall be present with a nonzero value in the header of a trace that contains
vector instructions.

While the STF spec attempts to be micro-architecture agnostic whenever
possible, traces containing RISC-V vector instructions are dependent on the
VLEN of the underlying architecture they were traced from.

Simulators that consume STF traces should ensure that the VLEN of a trace is
equal to the VLEN of the architecture being simulated.

A trace with no VLenConfigRecord is equivalent to one specifying VLEN == 0,
and implies that the trace cannot contain vector instructions.
