Encapsulates a single transaction in a transaction trace.

The metadata field is a variable-sized array of metadata elements that each
have the following structure:

[unstyled]
* b[7:0] Element type
** 0: uint8_t
** 1: uint16_t
** 2: uint32_t
** 3: uint64_t
** All other values are reserved
* b[8*sizeof(type)-1:8] Element value

The metadata is intended for attaching small amounts of additional
simulator-specific information (e.g. tag values, ID values, etc.) and should
not be used for large blocks of data.

The protocol data field is variable depending on the protocol ID of the trace.
See <<STF Transaction Protocols>> for details on how protocol data is encoded.
