Shall be used to capture any type of exception or external interrupt being generated in the course of program execution. (synchronous or asynchronous).

EventRecord with STF_EVENT_MODE_CHANGE Event ID is a special meta-event, and shall be emitted any time there is a change in privilege mode of execution (e.g. User, Supervisor). It shall be emitted at the start of each trace to indicate the starting privilege mode and with any FORCE_PC_RECORD if there is a change in privilege mode of execution.

This record will be associated with the instruction at which the event occurs. This instruction will appear again once it successfully executes, at a later time (e.g. upon returning from an interrupt/exception handler).

If this event is a fault, thrown due to an invalid instruction encoding ( i.e. fetch issue), generator tool shall report it as a no-op, while preserving and reporting the PC that triggered the fault.

Event metadata fields shail be 0-extended to 64-bit

stf_dump prints this record prefixed by "EVT "

*NOTE*: An earlier version of this specification used 32-bit values for the
event ID. Traces using 32-bit events can still be read by invoking
`reader.set32BitEvents(true)`.
