* b[63:0] Virtual address of the target memory being accessed by current instruction (read or write).
* b[79:64] memory access data size
* b[95:80] memory access attributes.
* b[103:96] access type
** 0 = Reserved
** 1 = Read
** 2 = Write

ToDo: List all access type encodings here (e.g. non-cacheable, write back write allocate, etc.) as well as encodings for prefetches, preloads, etc. +
include::../../include/stf-record.adoc[tag=record-desc]
Shall exist for every instruction doing memory read/write.

Different memory addresses coming from the same instruction shall be returned in order.

The record shall not be used to indicate memory accesses related to instruction address (i.e. fetch). Because we already have explicit information on instruction address (see FAQ item-3) and its instruction encoding content

When VAâ†’PA translation is available, this record shall follow a record with PA (not supported by the spec at this time)
