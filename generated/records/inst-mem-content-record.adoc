* b[63:0] Data/content of a memory being accessed by current instruction
include::../../include/stf-record.adoc[tag=record-desc]
This happens only for memory read/write instructions

Shall follow STF_INST_MEM_ACCESS

For memory accesses with data size less than 8 bytes, data shall be right justified, while exact address and size are expressed in the STF_INST_MEM_ACCESS record.

For memory accesses with data size greater than 8 bytes, use multiple STF_INST_MEM_CONTENT records, where the first STF_INST_MEM_CONTENT record refers to the address specified in the STF_INST_MEM_ACCESS record, and subsequent STF_INST_MEM_CONTENT records refer to subsequent target addresses appropriately incremented to preserve continuity of data.
