* b[15:0] Instruction encoding mode

Every tool that creates/modifies stf file shall append/update the InstIEMRecord.

Shall precede the very first instruction encoding record and every instruction
encoding change (STF_INST_16 or STF_INST_32) Note: other instruction encoding
lengths (e.g. 48-bit are not supported at this time)

Instruction encoding mode interpretation will depend on the ISA being traced, as
captured in the ISARecord.
