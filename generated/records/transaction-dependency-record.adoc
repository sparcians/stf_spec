May appear as part of a Transaction Record Group to indicate that the current
transaction depends on an earlier transaction.

The cycle delta field is used to indicate how many cycles of delay should
occur between when the dependency is fulfilled and when the current
transaction may be issued.

The clock ID field indicates the clock domain of the cycle delta. This may be
different from the clock ID of either the dependency or the current
transaction.
