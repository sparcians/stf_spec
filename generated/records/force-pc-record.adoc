* b[63:0] Virtual address of PC when program COF happens due to non-deterministic cases
include::../../include/stf-record.adoc[tag=record-desc]
Shall precede the very first instruction encoding record, and be emitted for
any program change of flow (COF) due to non-deterministic cases.

Every tool that creates/modifies stf file shall append a ForcePCRecord to
indicate the starting PC address.

This record indicates virtual address of PC when program change of flow (COF)
happens due to non-deterministic cases

The next STF_INST_16 / STF_INST_32 record's virtual address will match this
record's virtual address

Trace tools shall output the architectural PC (even if the low/high bits are
non-zero - e.g. ARM). Some architectures may add behaviours based on the
low/high bits.

Note this record is always 64 bit, even when running in 32bit IEM.

stf_dump shows this record as a standalone line item prefix "FORCE_PC"
