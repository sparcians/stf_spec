This record captures the page table entries (PTEs) accessed during a page table walk. This is a variable length record dependent on the depth of the page table walk.The last PTE in the record should be the leaf PTE that provides the memory translation.

Shall precede any new memory access to a page, where new memory access has one or more of the following meanings:

* The very first memory access, since the beginning of the trace, to an address (virtual) that belongs to a new page
* An access to a memory address (virtual) which has been accessed before, but has had an update to the virtual to physical page mapping since.

If there are multiple pages being accessed by an instruction meeting any of the "new memory access" requirements, then multiple page table walk records corresponding to those accesses shall precede the instruction record.

There shall be a page table walk record every time a unique page mapping changes or is newly introduced. Unique page mapping is uniquely identifiable by vmid, asid, and VA. i.e. when vmid and asid are not available, the trace format does not recognize PTE information, so we won't write it.

For RV32 only valid modes are Bare (no translation) and Sv32 (32 bit Virtual Addressing)

For RV64, besides Bare, Sv39 and Sv48 are supported

Attributes [7:0] are mapped the same for all cases, but the other bits are different between S32 vs. S39/S48

Attributes indicate, among other things, if this is a leaf PTE or not
